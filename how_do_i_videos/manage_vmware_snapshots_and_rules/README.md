[How Do I Manage VMware Snapshots in CloudBolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf-9jKkb9hk&list=PLGLC4DTwkytPhA7366eQ-xvWMVlf962Nk&index=3&ab_channel=CloudBoltSoftware)

## Code Description:
The find_old_vmware_snapshots.py file contains a slightly modified version of the out-of-the-box Find Old VMware Snapshots action in CloudBolt as shown in the YouTube video. The main difference is that this version filters the Resource Handlers that the plugin runs against to allow testing against a smaller set of vCenters.
