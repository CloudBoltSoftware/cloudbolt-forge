### Directory Organization
When there is partner code for a video in the series, it will be in a directory named after the video in snake case format without the `How Do I` and `in CloudBolt` portions of the title.  For example, the code for the video [How Do I Use Parameters in CloudBolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ato231__YaM) is in the directory `use_parameters`. Each directory will have a readme file with a link to the video and the YouTube video will have a link to the partner code in the description of the video.
