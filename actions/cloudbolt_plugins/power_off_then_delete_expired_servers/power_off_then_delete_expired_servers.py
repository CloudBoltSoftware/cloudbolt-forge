"""
Post-expire CloudBolt Plug-in that sends warning emails and possibly powers off
or deletes a server depending on how expired it is.

Parameters include the number of days a server should be expired before it is
powered off and the number of days it should be expired before it is deleted.
The hook also needs the hostname of a CB instance to use when providing links in
the warning emails.
