This 'docs' folder is specifically designated for publishing the CloudBolt Forge website using
GitHub Pages.
The name 'docs', is mandated by GitHub and cannot be changed.
Please do not add a README.md file to this directory,
as it will change the source of the main webpage.

The website is generated from the /docs folder in the master branch.
Each merge into the master branch triggers an automatic deployment of the site to the GitHub Pages environment,
initiated by our pages build and deployment workflow.
The website is publicly accessible at https://cloudboltsoftware.github.io/cloudbolt-forge/

For more information and to change current configuration refer to the Pages section of
the repository setting, https://github.com/CloudBoltSoftware/cloudbolt-forge/settings/pages
